# 🔐 SafeVault

> **Encrypt locally. Own your privacy.**  
> _An open-source client-side encryption platform for secure photo and video storage._

---

## 📖 Overview

Welcome to **SafeVault** — a privacy-first project aimed at helping users protect their sensitive photos and videos through **client-side AES encryption**.  
The idea is simple yet powerful:  
Upload your media → get back a coded encrypted file → store it safely → and later decrypt it using your personal password.  

This marks the **initialization** of the SafeVault project.  
Development will focus on creating a smooth user experience, strong encryption logic, and a world-class open-source implementation.

## ⚙️ Project Goals

- Build a modern and intuitive **Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS** frontend  
- Use **CryptoJS (AES + PBKDF2)** for secure, client-side encryption  
- Optionally integrate **Node.js + Express** backend for logging or user features  
- Keep all files **local** — no cloud uploads  
- Make it **open, transparent, and community-driven**

## ✨ Motivation & Development Plan
To create a world-class, open-source platform that empowers everyone to store personal media securely — with **zero dependency** on cloud storage or third-party access.
I’m deeply motivated to build this project because I believe privacy should be simple, accessible, and under everyone’s control.  
I’ll officially begin working on **SafeVault** during my **winter vacation**, but this project will **always remain open source**.  
Anyone interested is welcome to contribute at any time — every contribution, big or small, adds meaningful value to the open-source community and helps make SafeVault stronger for everyone. 💫
